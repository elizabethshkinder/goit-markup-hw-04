# Homework #4 HTML&CSS

- Created a new repository based on the previous homework;
- Exported the background image for the **hero** section;
- Optimized the image and placed it in the `images/` folder;
- Added the image using the `background-image` property;
- Applied a dark overlay gradient;
- Exported all icons from the layout without background;
- Specified icon dimensions in HTML;
- Created an SVG sprite using [IcoMoon](https://icomoon.io/);
- Optimized the sprite with [SVGOMG](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/);
- Renamed the optimized sprite to `icons.svg` and added it to the `images/` folder;
- Removed all `fill` attributes from the icons.
- Implemented the active page link with:
  - different text color;
  - an underline using the `::after` pseudo-element, as per the design.
- Added `transition` to all interactive elements (hover/focus effects);
- Transitions are declared in the base (default) state of each element;
- Explicitly specified animated properties via `transition-property`;
- Implemented a text overlay on cards that appears when hovering over any part of the card.
